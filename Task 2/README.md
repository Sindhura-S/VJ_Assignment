# Task 2: Semantic Segmentation Model Training (UNet on COCO)

This project trains a semantic segmentation model using a custom UNet. It logs training with TensorBoard and includes prediction visualizations.

Highlights:
- Manual UNet, no Ultralytics
- Multi-class (81) segmentation
- Albumentations, torchmetrics, TensorBoard
- Model checkpointing and visual evaluation
